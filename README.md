Python projects

This is a folder which I will periodically uploading Python projects of mine. Enjoy!

-------------------------------------------------------------

The "Automated Writing to File.py" file uses the os and the shutil modules from Python to create directories and move them to a target destination. The program's original aim stemmed from the thought, "Wouldn't it be nice to create files and folders automatically?". This idea could perhaps be scaled up to be used in a school. Where folders and files could be mass produced for students, equipped with documents and different folders for their work or even personal information.

The "Automated Spreadsheet.py" file is able to accept arrays as parameters into a function and can write them into a spreadsheet such as Excel. This could perhaps be used (after improvement) to produce a spreadsheet with employee data [things like names, gender, salaries]. Who knows.
